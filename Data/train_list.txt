/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0043.wav|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0042.wav|How could he explain his possession of the sketch|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0092.wav|He went down in midstream searching the shadows of both shores|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0010.wav|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0066.wav|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0051.wav|The lace was of a delicate ivory color faintly tinted with yellow|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0002.wav|Not at this particular case Tom apologized Whittemore|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0071.wav|What was the object of your little sensation|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0016.wav|There's Fort Churchill a rifle shot beyond the ridge asleep|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0079.wav|It was a large canoe|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0074.wav|And now down there Eileen was waiting for him|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0011.wav|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0056.wav|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0057.wav|I have no idea replied Philip|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0073.wav|The promoter's eyes were heavy with little puffy bags under them|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0046.wav|The girl faced him her eyes shining with sudden fear|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0049.wav|Gregson was asleep when he reentered the cabin|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0093.wav|For a full minute he crouched and listened|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0077.wav|It is the fire partly she said|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0038.wav|We will have to watch our chances|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0031.wav|They were three hundred yards apart|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0022.wav|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0033.wav|He unfolded a long typewritten letter and handed it to Gregson|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0097.wav|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0081.wav|What if she didn't come to the rock|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0050.wav|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0084.wav|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0027.wav|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0088.wav|He made sure that the magazine was loaded and resumed his paddling|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0034.wav|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0009.wav|He turned sharply and faced Gregson across the table|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0048.wav|He looked at the handkerchief more closely|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0060.wav|Anyway no one saw her like that|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0064.wav|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0075.wav|There has been a change she interrupted him|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0045.wav|He moved away as quietly as he had come|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0099.wav|A maddening joy pounded in his brain|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0053.wav|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0086.wav|Death had come with terrible suddenness|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0013.wav|He was a head shorter than his companion of almost delicate physique|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0037.wav|I was the only one who remained sitting|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0024.wav|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0040.wav|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0041.wav|Meanwhile I will go out to breathe a spell|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0019.wav|I followed the line of the proposed railroad looking for chances|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0067.wav|Surely I will excuse you she cried|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0062.wav|The men stared into each other's face|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0061.wav|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0008.wav|Gad your letter came just in time|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0035.wav|He stopped and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0100.wav|You must sleep he urged|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0047.wav|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0003.wav|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0052.wav|It was a curious coincidence|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0017.wav|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0039.wav|The ship should be in within a week or ten days|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0059.wav|His immaculate appearance was gone|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0069.wav|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0023.wav|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0063.wav|Yes it was a man who asked a stranger|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0025.wav|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0006.wav|God bless 'em I hope I will go on seeing them forever|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0007.wav|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0068.wav|In a flash Philip followed its direction|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0083.wav|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0020.wav|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0080.wav|What if Jeanne failed him|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0044.wav|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0091.wav|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0021.wav|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0001.wav|Author of the danger trail Philip Steels and etc|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0096.wav|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0058.wav|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0094.wav|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0054.wav|There was nothing on the rock|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0090.wav|The singing voice approached rapidly|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0026.wav|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0072.wav|But who was Eileen's double|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0085.wav|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face|1
/content/drive/MyDrive/225d_proj/chinese_accent_wav_100/arctic_a0078.wav|Then and at supper he tried to fathom her|1
